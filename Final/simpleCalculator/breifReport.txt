Entry and FinalEntry are stored in the linkeed list. 
I have commented the printList() function to not 
display the list. However, the marker, may remove
the comments and test to see the printLinkedList() if they wish to.

The write to a file is commented out as well because it will create a 
segmentation fault. it does create a file but writes "0/0/0" into the file
instead of the wanted data.
